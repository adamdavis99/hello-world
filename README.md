# Hello World Project for both Java and Deep Learning

This is a Hello World repository for my experimental programs. The Test folder contains all the Java code files that I have practiced. 

The interactive python files are the completed and saved "Goolge_Colab" files for the Introduction to Deep Learning Course by MIT.
